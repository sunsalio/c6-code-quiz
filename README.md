# c6-code-quiz

## Description
The motivation behind this project was to create an interactive coding quiz that challenges users with JavaScript-related questions. The goal was to provide a fun and educational experience for individuals interested in testing and enhancing their JavaScript knowledge.

Through this project, I learned how to structure and implement a quiz application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I gained insights into creating dynamic content, handling user interactions, and managing data with local storage. Additionally, the project involved working with timers, event handling, and manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM).

## Usage

1. Click on the "Start Quiz" button to begin the quiz.
2. Read each question and click on the button with the correct answer.
3. The quiz ends when you answer all questions or when the timer reaches 0.
4. After the quiz ends, enter your initials in the provided text box.
5. Click the "Submit" button to submit your score.
